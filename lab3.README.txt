*
* lab3.js:
*   - creates 16 faced 3-D star object initially set to rotate 15 deg. on x axis
*   - simple lighting and shading, blue with gold luster
*   - user arrow keys to rotate object forward/backward on x and y axes
*   - click on button to pause/play rotation
*   - I tried making sure the normals are all facing the right direction, 
*         but it still seems like a few faces are flipped. Maybe it's
*         just me.
*
*
* lab2.html:
*   - Applies rotation matrices
*   - Calculates normals and colors
*   - Displays the shape from lab2.js
